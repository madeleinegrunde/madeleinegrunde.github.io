I am first year PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Washington under the guidance of [Jeff Heer](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jheer/) and [Dan Weld](https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/weld). I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania this May with a major in Cognitive Science. 

In my previous work, I used different proxy tasks to investigate visual reasoning in humans and in models. I am interested in continuing to explore Human-AI Interaction and Interpretable AI, especially within Computer Vision.
