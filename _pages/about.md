Hi!

I am a fourth year Ph.D. student in the intersection of HCI and AI at the University of Washington. I am advised by [Jeffrey Heer](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jheer/) and [Daniel Weld](https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/weld), and I collaborate closely with [Ranjay Krishna](ranjaykrishna.com/).

My work centers on using AI for data-driven discovery while incorporating rather than replacing human judgement. I am motivated to explore questions such as: How can validation and user guidance be built into AI-backed tools? How can AI chaining architectures support meaningful user interactions? How can these tools support scientists and data analysts in discovering robust and reproducible findings? 

I am especially interested in exploring these questions related to environmental applications.
