Hello! 

I am a second year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Washington under the guidance of [Jeffrey Heer](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jheer/) and [Daniel Weld](https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/weld). 

As Artificial Intelligence systems increasingly impact daily life, I’m motivated to make the abilities and effects of these systems more interpretable. Drawing from my past work in Cognitive Science, Human-Computer Interaction, and Computer Vision, I’m especially interested in framing these evaluations within a societal context and providing insights into how to improve model behavior and the decisions of Human-AI teams.

Please feel free to reach me at *mgrunde at cs.washington.edu*.
