I am first year PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Washington under the guidance of [Jeff Heer](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jheer/) and [Dan Weld](https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/weld). I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania May 2021 with a major in Cognitive Science. In my previous work, I used different proxy tasks to investigate visual reasoning in humans and in models. In my PhD, my research centers around improving AI interpretation and evaluation, especially within Computer Vision. I am interested both in develping benchmarks and tools for interpretability, and in understanding how people's behavior changes in response to the analysis provided by these tools. Please feel free to reach me at *mgrunde at cs.washington.edu*.
